### Why was the language created?
    C# was created by a team of Microsoft Engineers led by Anders Hejlsberg who wanted a language to ship with the .Net Framework. Originally, .NET, was developed using Simple Managed C (SMC), but Anders team started the precurser of C# called C-Like Object Oriented Language or 'Cool' for short to replace SMC. Anders stated that flaws in most major programming languages at the time that drove the Common Language Runtime (CLR) ultimately led to the development of C#.

### What problems was the language trying to address?
    C# was trying to address flaws in other languages at the time to better suit the needs of the .NET Framework.
    
### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
    Most people claim C# is Microsoft's clone of java because of similarities at launch to which even Sun and Java's creators have claimed it to be, but according to the creator of C#, Andres Hejlsberg, it is not a clone of C# and closer to C++ in nature. Others have pointed out over time the languages have continued to diverge and accept different techniques, such as C#'s update to allow closure and LINQ extensions that helped developers write more functional style of code.
