# Unique Features of C#

## Linq Integration
> LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a Microsoft programming model and methodology that essentially adds formal query capabilities into Microsoft .NET-based programming languages. LINQ offers a compact, expressive, and intelligible syntax for manipulating data. LINQ is used in many languages but C# is the only one with it as a full integration and basic feature of the language as opposed to an added layer.

## Delegates
> A delegate in C# is similar to a function pointer in C or C++. Using a delegate allows you to encapsulate a reference to a method inside a delegate object. The delegate object can then be passed to code which can call the referenced method, without having to know at compile time which method will be invoked.

## Properties
> C# has support for properties which are members that autodefine getters and setters for you. This allows for differentiation between data members and function members.

## Extentions
> An extension method is a statically-defined method that operates on a particular type defined as the first parameter, and can be called in source code as if it were a member of the type. This allows you to "extend" the functionality of a class that you do not control.

## Dynamic Type
> While this feature is not strictly unique to C#, it is very unusual and rare for a statically typed language. Esentially the dynamic type tells the compiler to not statically resolve member calls or other variable behavior, and instead to work against a type with unknown specifics.
